# Alexa Tutor

## Alexa Tutor is a platform that makes it easier for students to keep track of their lectures.

You know how you love a course but still, there are moments where you totally phase out and wake up to realize you have missed some crucial stuff, or there is a reference to the last lecture which you understood well but you just a need a quick revision of what the Professor said in that lecture. This app sorts all these problems with even more functionalities. Alexa tutor takes notes in every lecture and displays in real time on the student's laptop. You can search for keywords and phrases in these notes. You can also email these notes to yourself. Additionally, this tutor uses intelligent machine comprehension to answer any questions and if you are not satisfied by Alexa tutor's answer, you can send the same questions to the Professor with one click.
